  <p><li><b>What is a Webpage</b></p></li>
  A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML (<em>HyperText Markup Language</em>). Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
  <li><p><b>How Coding Works</b></p></li>
  Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. For example, the computer might do this by making text<br>
  <em>like this</em>:<br>
  I'm &lt;b>learning&lt/b> to code!<br>
  <em>look like this</em>:<br>  
  I'm <b>learning</b> to code!
  <li><p><b>Programmers Can't Remember Everything</b></p></li>
  There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.
  <li><p><b>Basic HTML Vocabulary</b></p></li>
  <em>Tag</em>:<ul>An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (&lt;p> for example) and a closing tag, (&lt;/p>). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the &lt;br> tag).</ul>

  <em>Element</em>: <ul>An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.</ul>

  <em>Attribute</em>: <ul>This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write &lt;a href="www.udacity.com"></ul>

</ul>
